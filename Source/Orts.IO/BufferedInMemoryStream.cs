	/// <summary>
	/// A <see cref="Stream"/> which buffers both reads and writes in memory (as a <see cref="MemoryStream"/>).
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// <para>Treat this stream like any other; <see cref="Read"/>, <see cref="Write"/>, <see cref="Seek"/> all work normally (or close enough) in most
	/// cases. There are some specific exceptions, which shouldn't be a problem normally, outlined below.</para>
	/// <para>When reading, if the underlying stream does not report a length itself, the value reported by <see cref="Length"/> represents the amount
	/// buffered. The <see cref="BufferedInMemoryStream"/> attempts to keep the <see cref="Length"/> beyond the current seek location at all times.</para>
	/// <para>when reading, <see cref="Seek"/> will operate normally but only within the data already buffered; attempts to seek beyond this will raise
	/// an exception. There is no way to force a certain amount of data to be buffered.</para>
	/// <para>When writing, <see cref="Flush"/> is a no-op and <see cref="SetLength"/> is not implemented. None of the <see cref="Stream"/> methods and
	/// properties will cause data to be written to the underlying stream.</para>
	/// <para>When writing, to cause all buffered data to be written to the underlying stream, call <see cref="RealFlush"/>. This non-standard behavior
	/// is due to unfortunate existing code which calls <see cref="Flush"/> after writing to a <see cref="Stream"/>, which would otherwise cause us a
	/// problem with write-once underlying streams (which we're specifically trying to support here).</para>
