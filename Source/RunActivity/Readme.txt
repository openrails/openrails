Please note the distribution and use of Open Rails software is governed by the GNU License - see file Copying.txt. Source code can be downloaded from https://github.com/openrails/openrails

OPERATION
- You can run Open Rails by clicking on the Desktop icon or the Quick Launch icon or the Start Menu entry or C:\Program Files\Open Rails\OpenRails.exe
- Help and Game Controls are available in-game using the Help key (F1).
- Please read the operations manual in Open Rails > Documents > Manual.pdf

CONTENT
This Open Rails download does not include any content - no routes, trains, activities - just the simulation program. 

If you have content suitable for Open Rails or Microsoft Train Simulator already in place, then you can use the Open Rails program to operate those routes and drive those trains straight away. If not, then you will need to install some models bought from a vendor or free from the community before you can use Open Rails.

Use the Content button for some auto-install routes or visit the catalogue at www.openrails.org/download/explore-content

SUPPORT
Please send bug reports and feature requests to our Issue Tracker at https://github.com/openrails/openrails/issues/

UPDATES
Open Rails checks once a day for new versions and, if found, adds a red marker to the notification icon in the top right of the menu form. Click on the notification to find the details of an update and install it.
