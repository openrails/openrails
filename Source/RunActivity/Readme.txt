Open Rails software Readme.txt - Release v1.5
September 2022

Visit our web-page at http://openrails.org for details and links.

Please note the distribution and use of Open Rails software is governed by the GNU License - see file Copying.txt. 
Source code can be downloaded from https://github.com/openrails/openrails

OPERATION
- You can run Open Rails by clicking on the Desktop icon or the Quick Launch icon or the Start Menu entry or C:\Program Files (x86)\Open Rails\OpenRails.exe
- Help and Game Controls are available in-game using the Help key (F1).
- Please read the operations manual in Open Rails > Documents > Manual.pdf

CONTENT
This Open Rails download does not include any content - no routes, trains, activities - just the simulation program. 

If you have content suitable for Open Rails or Microsoft Train Simulator already in place, then you can use the
Open Rails program to operate those routes and drive those trains straight away.

If not, then you will need to install some models bought from a vendor or free from the community before you can use Open Rails.

Or you can try out the 2 self-installing models on our home page - both free of charge.

SUPPORT
Please send bug reports and feature requests to our Bug Tracker at https://launchpad.net/or
