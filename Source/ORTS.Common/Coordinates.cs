/*
 * 
 * COORDINATE SYSTEMS - XNA uses a different coordinate system than MSTS.  In XNA, +ve Z is toward the camera, 
 * whereas in MSTS it is the opposite.  As a result you will see the sign of all Z coordinates gets negated
 * and matrices are adjusted as they are loaded into XNA.  In addition the winding order of triangles is reversed in XNA.
 * Generally - X,Y,Z coordinates, vectors, quaternions, and angles will be expressed using MSTS coordinates 
 * unless otherwise noted with the prefix XNA.  Matrix's are usually constructed using XNA coordinates so they can be 
 * used directly in XNA draw routines.  So most matrix's will have XNA prepended to their name.
 * 
 * WorldCoordinates
 * X increases to the east
 * Y increases up
 * Z increases to the north
 * AX increases tilting down
 * AY increases turning to the right
 * 
 * LEXICON
 * Location - the x,y,z point where the center of the object is located - usually a Vector3
 * Pose - the orientation of an object in 3D, ie tilt, rotation - usually an XNAMatrix
 * Position - combines pose and location
 * WorldLocation - adds tile coordinates to a Location
 * WorldPosition - adds tile coordinates to a Position
