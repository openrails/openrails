OpenRails vs. MSTS Sound Management
===================================

OR executes .sms files to a very high degree of compatibility with MSTS. 

.sms Instruction Set
====================

OR recognizes and manages the whole MSTS .sms instruction set, in a way 
generally compatible with MSTS. The differences are described below.

The ``Activation ()`` instruction behaves differently from MSTS with regard 
to cameras (``CabCam``, ``ExternalCam`` and ``PassengerCam``): in general OR 
does not consider which cameras are explicitly activated within the .sms 
files. Instead, it uses a sort of implicit activation, that as a general rule 
works as follows:

- when in an inside view (cabview or passenger view) the related inside .sms 
  files are heard, plus all external .sms files (with the exception of those 
  related to the trainset where the camera is in that moment): the volume of 
  those external files is attenuated by a 0.75 factor.
- when in an external view all external .sms files are heard.

For an .sms file to be heard, it must be within the activation distance 
defined in the related instruction.

A hack is available so as to hear only in the cabview some .sms files 
residing outside the cabview trainset. This can be used e.g. to implement 
radio messages. For this to work the related .sms file must be called within 
a .wag file, must contain an ``Activation ( CabCam )`` statement, and the 
related wagon must be within a loose consist, within a not yet started AI 
train or within the consist where the cabview trainset resides. 

The ``ScalabiltyGroup ()`` instruction behaves differently from MSTS for AI 
trains. While MSTS uses ``ScalabiltyGroup ( 0 )`` for AI trains, OR uses for 
AI trains the same ``ScalabiltyGroup`` used for player trains. This way AI 
train sound can profit from the many more triggers active for AI trains in 
ORTS. For instance, Variable2 trigger is not active in MSTS for AI trains, 
while it is in ORTS.

If a ``Stereo()`` line is present within a ``ScalabiltyGroup``, and a mono .wav 
sound is called, MSTS will play the sound at double speed. In order to have it 
play at the correct speed, a frequency curve halving the speed has to be 
inserted. OR behaves the same as MSTS in this case.

Discrete Triggers
-----------------

Unlike MSTS, OR does not restrict the operation of some discrete triggers 
related to locomotives to the cabview related .sms file (usually named 
...cab.sms file). On OR they are all also active in the file related to the 
external view (usually named ...eng.sms file).

OR manages the following MSTS discrete triggers:

=========     ===============================================

MSTS .sms files for crossings (``crossing.sms``), control error and permission 
announcements (``ingame.sms``) together with their triggers, and for fuel tower are managed by OR.

MSTS triggers for derailment are currently not managed by OR.

MSTS .sms files related to weather (``clear_ex.sms``, ``clear_in.sms``, 
``rain_ex.sms``, ``rain_in.sms``, ``snow_ex.sms``, ``snow_in.sms``) are 
managed by OR.

The signal file (``signal.sms``) and its discrete trigger 1 is managed by OR.

Moreover, OR manages the extended set of discrete triggers provided by MSTSbin.

.. _sound-discrete:

OR-Specific Discrete Triggers
-----------------------------

OR manages the following set of new discrete triggers that were not present 
under MSTS. If MSTS (or MSTSbin) executes an .sms where such discrete 
triggers are used, it simply ignores the related statements.

In addition, OpenRails extends triggers 23 and 24 (electric locomotive power 
on/power off), that were introduced by MSTSbin, to diesel engines. Keys 
``<Shift+Y>`` (for diesel player engine) and ``<Ctrl+Y>`` (for diesel 
helpers), apart from physically powering on and off the diesel engines, 
trigger the above triggers.

Variable Triggers
-----------------

ORTS
^^^^

The sound objects attached to a vehicle (wagon or loco) can respond in volume and frequency to changes in the vehicle's properties.
There are a number of triggers as follows:

- distance squared from a sound source (m\ :sup:`2`)

- speed (m/s)	

- pressure in the brake cylinder (psi)	

- centrifugal force due to traversing a curve (N)	

- 3 variables in range 0 - 1:

  - Variable1 reflects the throttle. For steam locomotives it is possible to have multiple steam engines, thus this variable can be applied
   to each engine, by using a sound trigger of the form ``Variable1_x_inc_past`` or ``Variable1_x_dec_past``, where x = steam engine number.

  - Variable2 reflects the engine's RPM (diesel) or Tractive Force (electric) or cylinder pressure (steam). Where a Booster Engine is fitted, 
  then ``Variable2BoosterControlled`` can be used to control cylinder pressure for booster engines on steam locomotives.

  - Variable3 reflects the dynamic brake (diesel | electric) or fuel rate (steam)
		
Note: Separately, for a whole route, sounds for all curves below a certain radius can be automatically triggered as vehicles pass - see :ref:`sound-curve` below.	


Comparison with MSTS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

OR manages all of the variable triggers managed by MSTS. There can be some 
difference in the relationship between physical locomotive variables (e.g. 
Force) and the related variable. This applies to Variable2 and Variable3. 

New variables introduced by OR:

- BrakeCyl, which contains the brake cylinder pressure in PSI. Like the 
  traditional MSTS variables, it can be used to control volume or frequency 
  curves (``BrakeCylControlled``) and within variable triggers 
  (``BrakeCyl_Inc_Past`` and ``BrakeCyl_Dec_Past``).
- CurveForce, in Newtons when the rolling stock is in a curve. Can be used for 
  curve flange sounds, with two volume curves: one is ``SpeedControlled``, 
  which makes the sound speed dependent too, and ``CurveForceControlled``. 
  Of course ``CurveForce_Inc_Past``, and ``CurveForce_Dec_Past`` are also 
  available for activating and deactivating the sound.

Sound Loop Management
---------------------

Sound loop management instructions are executed as follows by OR:

- ``StartLoop`` / ``ReleaseLoopRelease``: the .wav file is continuously 
  looped from beginning to end; when the ReleaseLoopRelease instruction is 
  executed, the .wav file is played up to its end and stopped.
- ``StartLoopRelease`` / ``ReleaseLoopRelease``: the .wav file is played from 
  the beginning up to the last CuePoint, and then continuously looped from 
  first to last CuePoint; when the ``ReleaseLoopRelease`` instruction is 
  executed, the .wav file is played up to its end and stopped.
- ``StartLoopRelease`` / ``ReleaseLoopReleaseWithJump``: the .wav file is 
  played from the beginning up to the last CuePoint, and then continuously 
  looped from the first to the last CuePoint. When the 
  ``ReleaseLoopReleaseWithJump`` instruction is executed, the .wav file is 
  played up to the next CuePoint, then jumps to the last CuePoint and 
  stops. It is recommended to use this pair of instructions only where a 
  jump is effectively needed, as e.g. in horns; this because this couple of 
  instructions is more compute intensive and can lead to short sound breaks 
  in the case of high CPU loads.

Testing Sound Files at Runtime
------------------------------

The :ref:`sound debug window <driving-sound-debug>` is a useful tool for 
testing.

=========     =====================================

.. _sound-curve:

Automatic switch and curve squeal track sound
=============================================

With this feature a specific track sound is played when a train passes over any switch or 
crossover, or over a curve with a low radius, which highly enhances the sound experience.
If this feature is enabled there is no more 
need to lay down specific sound regions around or sound sources above every 
switch or over curves. This is a lengthy task, and in fact most of the routes aren't 
equipped with such sound regions or sound sources.
Three automatic sounds are supported::

-  switch sound
-  curve squeal sound
-  curve + switch sound (when wagon is both on curve and switch).

It is possible to define also only one or two of these automatic sounds. If switch and 
curve squeal sound are defined, and no curve + switch sound is defined, the curve squeal 
sound is played when a wagon is both on curve and switch.
The curve radius threshold below which the curve squeal sound is played is 350 meters for 
freight wagons and 301 meters for all other trainsets.

To enable this feature steps here below must be followed:

1. Suitable external and internal automatic sounds must be available (.sms files); 
   usually you find them in the root's ``SOUND``. It often occurs that switch track 
   and curve squeal sounds are available in modern routes. If not, they must be created 
   or searched on the web. A test sound set may be downloaded from 
   `here <http://www.interazioni-educative.it/Varie/DemoAutoSound.zip>`_.
2. For every route it must be checked whether a reference to the three automatic track 
   sounds are present in the route's ``ttype.dat`` file. If they are, you can proceed 
   to next step. 
   Else you must insert three new lines at the end of ``ttype.dat``, adding the reference 
   to the automatic track sounds, and you must add 3 to the number on top of the file.
   Here below an example of a default ``ttype.dat`` can be found,  where three new lines 
   referring to the above test sound have been added in last position::

3. For every route you must tell OR which of the ttype sound files are those related to 
   automatic sounds. This is done by inserting following line in the route's ``.trk`` file::
     
     ORTSSwitchSMSNumber ( 10 )
     ORTSCurveSMSNumber ( 11 )       
     ORTSCurveSwitchSMSNumber ( 12 ) 

   A better solution, because it leaves the ``.trk`` file unaltered, is to create an 
   ``OpenRails`` subfolder within the route's folder, and to put in it an integration 
   ``.trk`` file, named like the base one, and with following sample content (supposing 
   the base .trk file is named ``ITALIA13.trk``::


       -> BLANK LINE HERE <- 
       include ( "../ITALIA13.trk" )
          ORTSDefaultTurntableSMS ( turntable.sms )
          ORTSSwitchSMSNumber ( 10 )
          ORTSCurveSMSNumber ( 11 )       
          ORTSCurveSwitchSMSNumber ( 12 )  

Note that a blank line must be present above the ``include`` line, but that is difficult to reproduce in this manual.

Note also that with the same integration ``.trk`` file also the default turntable sound 
is defined, in case this route has turntables or transfertables.                  
 
As already stated, you can also define in ``ttype.dat`` and in the ``.trk`` file only 
one or only two types of automatic sounds.

.. _sound-external:   

Override % of external sound heard internally for a specific trainset
=====================================================================

External sounds are reproduced at a lower volume when heard within a cab or 
passenger view. The % of external sound heard internally is defined in the 
``Audio Options`` menu window.

.. index::
   single: ORTSExternalSoundPassedThroughPercent

This percentage may be overridden for any trainset inserting in the Wagon 
section of any .eng or .wag file (or in their "include" file as explained 
:ref:`here <physics-inclusions>`) following line::

  ORTSExternalSoundPassedThroughPercent ( 50 ) 

where the number in parenthesis may be anyone from 0 (nothing heard internally) 
to 100 (external sound reproduced at original volume).  


.. _sound-internal-track:   

Manage % of internal track sound heard internally for a specific trainset
=========================================================================

The percentage of internal track sound heard internally for a specific 
trainset may be defined for any trainset inserting in the Wagon 
section of any .eng or .wag file (or in their "include" file as explained 
:ref:`here <physics-inclusions>`) following line::

  ORTSTrackSoundPassedThroughPercent ( 40 ) 

where the number in parenthesis may be anyone from 0 (nothing heard ) 
to 100 (internal track sound reproduced at volume as defined in .sms file).  

If the parameter is not present, the internal track sound is 
reproduced at the volume as defined in .sms file.

Conditional sound
=================

In the real world some sounds are present only at a specific time (season and/or 
time of day) and/or with a specific weather.

OR provides the parameters to actuate that for any set of sound streams. Consider the 
sound stream here below::

  			Stream (
				Priority ( 6 )
				ORTSSeason ( Spring () winter () )
				ORTSWeather ( rain () )
				ORTSTimeOfDay ( 7 12 )
				ORTSTimeOfDay ( 13 20 )
				Triggers ( 2
					Variable_Trigger ( Distance_Dec_Past 400.0
						StartLoop ( 1
							File ( "Somma_annunci_loud.wav" -1 )
							SelectionMethod ( SequentialSelection )
						)
					)
					Variable_Trigger ( Distance_Inc_Past 400.0 ReleaseLoopRelease ())
				)

				VolumeCurve(
					DistanceControlled
					CurvePoints ( 4
	  					 0.0	1.0
						230.0	1.0
	  					260.0	0.0
						2000.0  0.0
					)
					Granularity (0.01)
				)
			)


As can be seen, there are three keywords, that are ORTSSeason, ORTSWeather and 
ORTSTimeOfDay. If one or more of the three keywords is not present in the stream, 
the sound does not depend from that keyword.

In the example shown, the sound is played if all conditions are met, that is season 
is spring or winter and weather is rain and time of day is within one of the two 
intervals 7-12 or 13-20. There may be as many TimeOfDay lines as wanted, 
but the granularity is one hour.
