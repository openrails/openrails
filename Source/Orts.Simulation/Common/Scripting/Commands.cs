    /// was pressed.
    /// 
    /// Each command class has a Receiver property and calls methods on the Receiver to execute the command.
    /// This property is static for 2 reasons:
    /// - so all command objects of the same class will share the same Receiver object;
    /// - so when a command is serialized to and deserialised from file, its Receiver does not have to be saved 
    ///   (which would be impractical) but is automatically available to commands which have been re-created from file.

    /// Before each command class is used, this Receiver must be assigned, e.g.
    ///   ReverserCommand.Receiver = (MSTSLocomotive)PlayerLocomotive;
