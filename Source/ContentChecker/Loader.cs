// The Loader class is the base class for all kinds of classes that load files
// An instance of a loader (sub)class has the responsibility to
//  * Load a single file. The kind of file that is being loaded depends on the actual subclass.
//    The loading should be done by instantiating a class from ORTS that is used to load such a file
//    in the regular simulator. In that way all messages and possibly errors are handled in the same way
//    as during simulation.
//    Note that since each Loader (sub)class is responsible for loading a single type of file, 
//    for each type of file a separate loader (sub)class is needed.
//  * If so requested, identify additional related files. For all these related files a filename
//    needs to be determined, as well as the Loader subclass that should be used for that kind of file.
//    The actual loading is done at a higher hierarchy level.
//
// In general each instance should load only one file. The reason for this is that it allows,
// at a later stage, to make it easier to do cross-checking of different files.
//
// One of the big differences with the normal ORTS code is that the normal code really starts
// from a single start-point (the .trk file). Here, however, we want to be able to load only 
// a limited set of files: so we need to have a little more independence.
//
// Note that any exception handling dring loading is not done in the loader (sub)classes. This is
// done at a higher level, currently.
