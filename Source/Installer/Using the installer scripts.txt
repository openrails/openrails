Using the installer scripts.txt
Last updated: 2025-06-21 by Chris Jakeman

Compiling the scripts and data files on your own PC and testing them there or on a virtual machine
==================================================================================================

1. If you wish to update the version name from "1.6", then edit the line
     #define MyAppVersion "1.6"
	 in the file 
   Source\Installer\Version.iss
     and update the Release number and date in:
   Source\RunActivity\Readme.txt
     and in
   Source\RunActivity\Prerequisites.txt
   
   The text in these documents is shown by the Installer to the user, so check this is still up to date.
   
2. Download and install Inno Setup from http://www.jrsoftware.org/isdl.php
Initial trials (Apr 2014) used v5.5.4. Open Rails v1.6 uses 6.4.3

3. Download Microsoft .NET Framework 4.7.2 web installer package for Windows from:
    https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/microsoft-net-framework-4-7-2-web-installer-for-windows-dda5cddc-b85e-545d-8d4a-d213349b7775
   and save in
  <A>\.NET Framework 4.7.2 web installer\ndp472-kb4054531-web.exe
  where <A> is any folder.
  
4. Make a chain of folders inside folder <A>: <A>\Temp\Installer\
   From Source\Installer, copy OpenRails.iss and Version.iss into <A>\Temp\Installer
  
5. Repeat the following as often as required:
  A. Download OR zip file from https://github.com/openrails/openrails/releases, choose the latest (i.e. pre-release) version, open the Assets concertina and pick Open Rails <version>.zip where <version> is something like "1.6-rc2"

  B. Unzip into folder 
    <A>\Program\

  C. Remove 
    <A>\Program\Updater.ini 
  as James Ross advises because the updater cannot update an installed version yet.

  D. Download source from https://github.com/openrails/openrails/releases, choose the latest (i.e. pre-release) version, open the Assets concertina and pick Source code Open Rails <version> Source.zip where <version> is something like "1.6-rc2" and extract the folder Source\Documentation.

  E. Copy contents into folder
    <A>\Program\Documentation\
	
  F. If you made changes to Source\RunActivity\Readme.txt or Source\RunActivity\Prerequisites.txt in Step 1, then
  copy them to <A>\Program\ to overwrite the downloaded files.

  G. Use Inno Setup Compiler > Build > Compile to compile the installer script
    <A>\Temp\Installer\Installer.iss
	and generate the Open Rails Installer
  
  H. The generated file will be found in <A>\Temp\Installer\Output\OpenRailsSetup.exe
 
6. Test the installer by building Virtual Machines with a fresh copy of Windows.
Open Rails v1.6 is compatible with Windows from 7 (SP1) to 11 and, hopefully, beyond.

Arrange for the VM to have Internet access and a shared folder.
Copy OpenRailsSetup.exe to the shared folder.
Copy a VM with a fresh copy of Windows to make a sacrificial trial platform.
VirtualBox has Remove and Clone options on the right mouse button.
VMWare finds a copy made using File Explorer and asks if that was a Copy or Move operation.
From inside the VM, copy the OpenRailsSetup.exe file from the shared folder to a new folder C:\_tmp\
That avoids a ShellExecuteEx error code 3 "The system cannot find the path specified."
