<h2>Demo Model 1</h2>
<p>
You can try out Open Rails by <a href="http://www.openrails.org/files/DemoModel1.zip" title="Warning: large download - 250MB">downloading this model</a> to drive the route from Edinburgh towards Glasgow.
</p><p>
Models contain lots of detail
and this model, which is cut down from a full-size commercial route, compresses to 250MB. Installation instructions are included.
</p><p>

<p style="text-align: center">Edinburgh Waverley station</p>
The model, generously donated by Making Tracks Ltd, reproduces the route between the Scottish capitals during the "blue" period of British Rail. Your service is a morning express from Edinburgh Waverley as far as the town of Linlithgow, about 20 minutes running.
</p><p>
You can also watch a player driving the route on Open Rails in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZ5aVEvbOOE&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">this video</a>, which provides a voice-over.

<h2>Stand-alone Content</h2>
<p>
  Some content relies on the presence of files from MSTS, such as sound files and cab interiors.
  This is usually the case for free content downloaded from forums, so installing this content can be tricky.
</p>
<p>
  Content which has no such dependence (typically labelled as "stand-alone" or "mini-route") is easy to install.
  All the content on this page is stand-alone.
