          Peter Newell hosts the "Coals to Newcastle" website which is packed with useful technical information
          for accurate simulation using Open Rails.
        </p><p>
          Peter and his collaborators have designed and tested this tutorial which is aimed at first-time
          users of Open Rails.
        </p><p>
          The material includes a copy of the finished route you can download, so you can see all the features before you create them, 
          and also check that you've built everything correctly.
