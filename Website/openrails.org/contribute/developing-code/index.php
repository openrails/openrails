    <div class="accordion_body">
      <p>
The Open Rails project uses Git as the versioning and revision control system for our software.
Revisions are kept in <a href="https://github.com/openrails/openrails">a public repository at GitHub.com</a> and can be compared, restored and merged, so that versions are safe and several developers can work
 independently without (too much) conflict.
      </p><p>
From your PC, you can simply view the repository from a web browser. 
GitHub.com provides the GitHub Desktop program to interface between GitHub.com and your PC (for 64-bit Windows only).
Other Windows programs are SourceTree and TortoiseGit and also Visual Studio includes a Git tool.
See our <a href="https://onedrive.live.com/view.aspx?resid=7F0F05E28F47C189!295694&ithint=file%2cdocx&authkey=!ABYL6qOsIy85Bdc">step-by-step instructions for starting to work with Git</a>.
      </p><p>
The main folders in the repository are:
    </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Addons - accessory files shipped with the installation package</li>
        <li>Design - documents recording the design of OR components</li>
        <li>Documentation - operations manual and other documentation</li>
        <li>Program - empty space for executables once they are compiled</li>
        <li>Source - the principal source code files</li>
        <li>Website - source for this website</li>

      <p>
To compile and debug the Open Rails source code, ensure you have the following Microsoft products installed:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Visual Studio 2022, any edition. The 
          <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/">Community Edition</a> 
         is free
		 <br />(Note: To save on disk space, all you need is the option Windows > .NET desktop development)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p>
After you have downloaded the code:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Open folder <i>Source</i></li>
        <li>Double click on file <i>ORTS.sln</i> to launch Visual Studio with the Open Rails project</li>
        <li>From the Visual Studio menu, select <i>Build > Rebuild Solution</i></li>
        <li>In the status bar (lower left), wait for the message 'Rebuild All succeeded'</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The executable files have now been built and placed in the <i>Program</i> folder.</p>

    <div class="accordion_body">
      <p>
Note: When debugging you will bypass the normal start menu and must specify an activity on the command line.
      </p><p>
On the Visual Studio menu,
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select <i>View > Solution Explorer</i></li>
        <li>In the <i>Solution Explorer</i> box (on the right), right click on <i>RunActivity > Properties</i></li>
        <li>Use the Debug tab (on the left) to open the Debug Window.</li>
        <li>Into the "Command line arguments", enter the path of the activity that you want to run: e.g. "c:\personal\msts\routes\lps\activities\ls1.act". 
         Use quotes if the path has spaces in it.
        </li>
        <li>Below this, check the checkbox for "Enable native code debugging"</li>
        <li>Press F5 to run RunActivity.exe using your activity.</li>

      <p>
        The Open Rails source tree includes a number of unit and integration tests, primarily for portions of the code that deal with data processing. All code changes must pass these tests. Developers are also encouraged to write their own tests for any code that lends itself to testing.
      </p>
      <p>
        After opening the solution in Visual Studio,
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select <em>Test > Test Explorer</em></li>
        <li>Wait for the tests to populate in the <em>Test Explorer</em> pane</li>
        <li>In the top-left corner of this pane, select "Run All Tests," or press Ctrl-R, then A.</li>

    <div class="accordion_body">
      <p>
        To allow many people to contribute directly to Open Rails successfully, we have a policy in place to keep tabs on where 
        changes come from and which changes are allowed. 
        The policy is set out in the document <a href="https://github.com/openrails/openrails/blob/master/Docs/Contributing.md">Contributing.md</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        For members of the <a href="../../discover/project-team/">Development Team</a>, these policies are defined in more detail in
        <a href="http://www.elvastower.com/forums/index.php?/topic/26392-new-policy-for-code-changes/">Policy for code changes</a>
        and
