        <h2>Meeting the Team</h2>
        <p>
The Project Team meets on <a href="http://www.elvastower.com">the Elvas Tower bulletin board</a> where Dave Nelson has encouraged us from the very beginning.
He provides <a href="http://www.elvastower.com/forums/index.php?/forum/190-open-rails-simulator-project/">hosting for our public discussions</a> and private threads so, although we hang out on other boards too, this is the one to follow.

        <h2>Roles and Focus</h2>
        <p>
Most of the team has a focus even if we help out with several roles. Here is the currently active team but it's difficult to keep track of everyone, so please get in touch if your name is missing or you would like it removed.
        </p><p>

<h2>Software Development</h2>
<p>
The "Devs" for short. These are the guys who commit code to the repository; making bug-fixes or extending a feature to work with every permutation that the modelers can throw at them.
</p><p>
Less frequently, they get to add something entirely new and then stand ready to catch the inevitable problems that arise because no one can think of everything.

<h2>Testers</h2>
<p>
We've had some very valuable work done when a developer pairs with a tester to research, implement and refine a new feature. You could say that testers keep the devs honest :-)
</p>
<h2>Content Builders</h2>
<p>
These are the experts in creating buildings, locos, routes, signs, even grass. They push for more realistic appearance (e.g. smoke) and more "polys" and are forever frustrated by the lack of a better route editor than MSTS provides.

<h2>Translators</h2>
<p>
A choice of language was added to OR in Spring 2014 and, very quickly, a cadre of translators has come into being to jump on every new feature and render it in at least 9 languages.
