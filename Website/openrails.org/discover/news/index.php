        <h2>Apr 2014 - Smoother, More Detailed Graphics</h2>
        <p>
          Open Rails currently uses DirectX 9 and, although this is not the latest version of DirectX, hidden away inside is a method for reducing the
          number of "draw calls" which the CPU makes to the GPU. Fewer calls mean higher frame rates, smoother motion and the capacity to handle
          more detail.
        </p><p>
        The technique is called "hardware instancing" and allows identical objects (e.g. trees in a forest) to be combined into a single draw
        call. The work is transferred to the GPU which copies them as many times as necessary and usually has spare capacity.
        </p><p>
        You can expect some increases in frame rate, especially on routes with many identical objects. To turn this on, tick the checkbox for<br>
        <span class="tt">Options > Experimental > Use model instancing</span>

        <h2>Mar 2014 - Work Starts On Timetables</h2>
        <p>
          A schedule of trains (or timetable) is nearly impossible to arrange in Microsoft Train Simulator as AI trains don't adhere to booked station stops. In Open Rails,
          the situation is better but an activity with a player train and AI traffic is still very different from a timetable.
        </p><p>
          Work has now begun on a timetable element which is an alternative to the usual activity. The timetable will contain all the details
          needed for each scheduled train - path, consist, booked stops etc.. Conventional activities will continue as before.
        </p><p>
          Also there is no longer any distinction between player train or AI train - any train in the timetable can be selected as the player
          train, the others are operated by a remote player or by the simulator.
