<h2>Sharing In Open Rails</h2>
<p>
If we look beyond the Open Rails Development Team, who do we find?
</p><p>
Firstly, there are the people who have invested countless hours in developing and sharing more capable and more realistic models. 
They frequent the forums listed opposite and may have published many files of content. They've probably
chosen MSTS because it is more satisfying than its rivals. But MSTS is a dead end and this band of enthusiasts have been hoping that Open Rails
might give their interest a new lease of life; one that is potentially unlimited.
</p><p>
Then there are others who perhaps have come more recently to the hobby. It's a long time since 2001 and they find MSTS unreliable and awkward
compared to modern products. But Open Rails is robust, shows much promise and its open nature is more appealing than commercial products, so they follow its progress on the forums.
</p><p>
We have commentators on the whole train simulator world, such as Nicholas Ozorak's video library <em>At The Railyard</em>. For his independent opinion, watch <a href="http://www.attherailyard.com/seasonfiveepisodes.htm" target="_blank">this video review of Open Rails</a>.
</p><p>
Finally we have the experts who collaborate to produce quality models for sale - for more, see <a href="../../trade/">Trade</a>.
