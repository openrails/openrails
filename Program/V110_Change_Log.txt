Version 110 Changes

Scenery.cs
-- Made the WorldFile[] array public so dynamic track objects (and forest objects in the future) can be read by the viewer.
-- Added capability in the WorldFile class to check for dynamic tracks and create an instance of DynamictrackDrawer for each one that is found.
-- Added a dynaTrack List collection to the WorldFile class to store DynamictrackDrawer instances. 
-- PrepareFrame: Added an iterative search of DynatrackDrawer instances in the dynaTrack List of each member of the WorldFiles[] array.

Materials.cs
-- Added a Dynatrack material to render each of the three primitives with the proper render states.
-- Materials class: Added DynatrackMaterial declaration and instantiation. Added DynatrackMaterial to the Load method switch statement.
-- Added ability to read and display textures from the "night" folder.

Shaders.cs
-- Added isNightTex flag to SceneryShader class

SceneryShader.fx
-- Added isNightTex flag and code to skip darkening of night textures.

Dynatrack.cs
-- New class. Constructor creates an instance of DynatrackMesh using world file dynamic track configuration parameters. 
-- DynatrackMesh calculates the vertex positions and triangle indices based on the cross-section profile of MSTS "A1t" track.
-- DynatrackMesh includes a Draw method to separately draw the three track primitives: ballast base, rail sides, and rail tops.

WFile.cs
-- Added ability to read Dynamic Track world file objects from binary W files (was only reading from Unicode files before). 

Terrain.cs
-- Added ability to access the "Snow" terrtex when it's winter and/or snowing.
