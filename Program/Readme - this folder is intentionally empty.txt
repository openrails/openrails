If you wish to stay up-to-date with Open Rails development versions, you have two choices:

* Weekly experimental releases from http://openrails.org/experimental.html
* Automatic builds from http://james-ross.co.uk/projects/or/builds

Both of the above options include a built-in updater which will alert you 
whenever a new version of that particular release is available and allow you 
to update to it with just two clicks (one to accept the update and one to 
restart Open Rails).

If you have any unanswered questions, please use the forum thread above.

Thanks.
