WFile.cs
-- Added ability to read Forest object world file objects instead of skipping over them. 
-- Added new ForestObj parser class. Inherits from WorldObject.

Scenery.cs

-- Added a forestList collection to the WorldFile class to store ForestDrawer instances. 
-- PrepareFrame: Added an iterative search of ForestDrawer instances in the forestList of each member of the WorldFiles[] array.

Materials.cs

Forest.cs
-- New file consisting of ForestDrawer and ForestMesh classes.
-- ForestDrawer constructor creates an instance of ForestMesh using world file ForestObj configuration parameters. 
-- Using the ForestObj configuration parameters, ForestMesh creates an array of type VertexPositionNormalTexture. Each vertex contains information about its position, size, and texture coordinates.

Forest.fx
-- New file. Displays forest object trees as bilboards.

Shapes.cs
-- Moved texture folder switch block to Helpers.cs.

Helpers.cs
-- New File. Contains GetTextureFolder() which gets the path to the texture folder appropriate to the value of ESD_Alternative_Texture and the current weather conditions.
-- Code was moved from Shapes.cs, which still calls it, as does Forest.cs.
